This is a program with makes exporting sprites for modding more convenient. 
Doesn't import them though. That's what modloader is for.
I apologize for the ulginess of the GUI, I have literally never done this before.

INSTRUCTIONS: 

Run the EXE, 
select your SWF file, 
reload the skin optins, 
select your skin's name, 
and export what you want.

This does also work for Weapon Skins and Sig Effects, but it wasn't designed with those in mind and may be unreliable.

Exported files will be put in the same directory as the EXE, and you can put the EXE where ever you want, 
it can be seperate from the sourcecode.
All exported files will be in the same directory as the EXE. So if you put the EXE on your desktop, then 
the exported files will be on your desktop as well.
