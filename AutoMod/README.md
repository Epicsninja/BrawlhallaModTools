This is a program that makes updating mods more convenient.
Provided you make your mod follow the correct format, this tool should
allow you to update the mod to any patch.

INSTRUCTIONS: 

Run the EXE, 
select your unmodded SWF file, 
select your mod source folder (which must follow the correct format),
press install mod, and you will have a modded SWF file.

This currently only works for Legend skins. I will probably make it work for Weapon Skins eventually.
