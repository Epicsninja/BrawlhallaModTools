# BrawlhallaModTools
A set of tools and utilities for modding the game Brawlhalla. Most of these are pretty simple, and I'm surprised no one else has made them yet. All of this is open source, and all code is public. Just give appropriate credit if you use any of this.

The JPEX FFDEC library is used in this project. It, and the decompiler itself, can be downloaded here: https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler
